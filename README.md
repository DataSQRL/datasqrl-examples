# DataSQRL Use Cases and Examples

This is a repository for real world [DataSQRL](https://github.com/DataSQRL/sqrl) use cases and examples.

* **[Finance Credit Card Chatbot](finance-credit-card-chatbot/)**: Build a data pipeline that enriches and analyzes credit card transaction in real time and feeds the data into a GenAI chatbot to answer customer's questions about their transactions and spending. The extended example shows how to build a credit card rewards program and GenAI agent that sells credit cards.
* **[Healthcare Study](healthcare-study-monitoring/)**: Build a data pipeline for enriching healthcare data and querying it in realtime through an API, for data analytics in Iceberg, and publishing it to Kafka.
* **[Law Enforcement](law-enforcement)**: Build a realtime data pipeline for capturing and tracking warrants and Bolos.
* **[Oil & Gas IoT Automation Agent](oil-gas-agent-automation)**: Build a realtime data enrichment pipeline that triggers an agent to analyze abnormal events for automated troubleshooting.
* **[Clickstream AI Recommendation](clickstream-ai-recommendation/)**: Build a personalized recommendation engine based on clickstream data and vector content embeddings generated by an LLM.
* **[IoT Sensor Metrics](iot-sensor-metrics/)**: Build an event-driven microservice that ingests sensor metrics, processes them in realtime, and produces alerts and dashboards for users.
* **[Logistics Shipping](logistics-shipping-geodata/)**: Build a data pipeline that processes logistics data to provide real-time tracking and shipment information for customers.
* **[User Defined Function](user-defined-function/)**: This small tutorial shows how to include your call a custom function in your SQRL script.

## Running the Examples

### Prerequisites

To compile and run these examples with DataSQRL you need to have a [recent version of Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.

### Running & Compiling Examples

To run the examples on Linux or MacOS, open a terminal and run the following command:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 8081:8081 -p 9092:9092 -v $PWD:/build datasqrl/cmd:latest run [ARGUMENTS GO HERE]
```

If you are on windows using Powershell, you need to reference the local directory with a slightly different syntax:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 8081:8081 -p 9092:9092 -v $PWD:/build datasqrl/cmd:latest run [ARGUMENTS GO HERE]
```

Check the `README.md` in the respective directory for more information on the arguments to run each example. 
We will be using the Unix syntax, so keep in mind that you have to adjust the commands slightly on Windows machines by using `${PWD}` instead.

To compile an example (without running it), use this command:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/build datasqrl/cmd:latest compile [ARGUMENTS GO HERE]
```
