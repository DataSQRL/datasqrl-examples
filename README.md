# DataSQRL Use Cases and Examples

This is a repository for real world DataSQRL use cases and examples.

* **[Clickstream AI Recommendation](clickstream-ai-recommendation/)**: Build a personalized recommendation engine based on clickstream data and vector content embeddings generated by an LLM.
* **[Finance Credit Card Chatbot](finance-credit-card-chatbot/)**: Build a data pipeline that enriches and analyzes credit card transaction in real time and feeds the data into a GenAI chatbot to answer customer's questions about their transactions and spending. The extended example shows how to build a credit card rewards program and GenAI agent that sells credit cards.
* **[IoT Sensor Metrics](iot-sensor-metrics/)**: Build an event-driven microservice that ingests sensor metrics, processes them in realtime, and produces alerts and dashboards for users.
* **[Logistics Shipping](logistics-shipping-geodata/)**: Build a data pipeline that processes logistics data to provide real-time tracking and shipment information for customers.
* **[Retail Nutshop](retail-customer360-nutshop/)**: Build a realtime Customer 360 application for an online shop with personalized recommendations.
* **[User Defined Function](user-defined-function/)**: This small tutorial shows how to include your call a custom function in your SQRL script.


## Running the Examples

Running these examples requires the DataSQRL compiler. The easiest way to run the DataSQRL compiler is in Docker. This requires that you have a [recent version of Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine. Alternatively, you can also [install DataSQRL](/update) directly on your machine which is faster and provides additional testing features. 

Check the `README.md` in the respective directory for more information on how to run each example.

### Using Python in examples

Some of our examples require python to generate their test data or to ingest them to Kafka.

It is recommended to use virtualenv to manage your python environment. Some IDEs require to place requirements.txt
and venv folder in the project root. That's why it is in the root, even though not all "modules" are utilizing it.

Here's how to use venv in this project:

- Create a virtual env in the project root folder: `python3 -m venv venv`
- Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
  - *you can later deactivate it with this command:* `deactivate`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
